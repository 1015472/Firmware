/*
 * This class handles different sets of buttons according to their
 * previous and current status (pressed / not pressed), and duration of pressing a button.
 *
 * Duration of pressing a button is used to distinguish
 * button click and longpress (i.e. long button press)
 *
 * Status of all buttons in a set is defined by the bitmap variable `mask`, which
 * can be set using method `cButtonController::setMask(button_set bs, uint32_t bitmask)`
 * So count of buttons in a set is limited to number of bits in uint32_t (i.e. 32)
 * Bitmap variable `mask` is defined as follows:
 *	- Bit N is set to **1** if N'th button is **not pressed**
 *	- Bit N is set to **0** if N'th button is **pressed**
 *
 * Each set of buttons is checked in the method `cButtonController::cycle` by
 * calling `cButtonController::check(button_set, array_of_buttons, count_of_buttons)`
 * for each button set.
 *
 * Each button is handled by a callback that is defined for the button set.
 * First two arguments of a callback are:
 *	void*	- optional argument	(meant to be used to pass `this` variable
 *								 if callback method is located in a class)
 *	uint8_t	- number of a button
 *
 * Callback must return:
 *	BUTTON_HANDLED (defined as true)	- if the button *was successfully handled*
 *										- and *no* other callback must be called.
 *	BUTTON_IGNORED (defined as false)	- if the button *was not handled*
 *										- and another callback can be called.
 *
 * There are two types of callbacks:
 *  - Clicked:	called when a button was pressed in the previous iteration of cycle
 *				but is no longer pressed in the current iteration of cycle.
 *				(i.e. button pressed and released)
 *				Accepts additional argument:
 *					- `bool longpress`: whether the button was pressed longer than _LONG_PRESS_TIME_
 *
 *  - Pressed:	called when a button is pressed first time and each iteration of cycle.
 *				Accepts additional arguent:
 *					- `hrt_abstime time`: duration pressing the button
 *
 * If callback pressed returns BUTTON_IGNORED and
 * callback clicked is set and duration of pressing the button exceeds _LONG_PRESS_TIME_ then
 * callback **clicked** is called with argument `longpress=true`, if it is handled then
 * `ignore_mask` is set to ignore the pressed button in next cycle iterations untill it is released.
 *
 * There are 5 possible conditions of a button,
 * only 4 of them are handled:
